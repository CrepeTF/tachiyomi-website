Most of your issues can probably be solved from this page.","path":"/help/faq/","content":"\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Application\n\n### Library\n\n#### How can I see how many chapters I've downloaded?\nThis can be done by enabling **Download badges** under <Navigation item=\"library\"/>.\n\n:::e-guide\nEnable it by going to <Navigation item=\"library\"/> → <Navigation item=\"filter\"/> → **Display** section and then checking the **Download badges** option at the bottom.\n:::\n\n#### Why are some covers white after restoring from backup?\nThe URL to the cover has probably changed. To fix this, refresh the metadata of your library.\n\n:::e-guide\nRefresh your metadata by going to <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_advanced\"/> then pressing **Refresh library metadata**.\n:::\n\n#### How do I ignore chapters from certain scanlator groups?\nEvery now and then you find a manga that is translated by more than one group. Because of this, you get multiple releases for each chapter in the manga. The easiest way to fix this is to change sorting to **Total chapters**. You won't see any changes but, when you start reading you'll automatically skip the duplicate releases.\n\n:::e-guide\nChange library sorting by going to <Navigation item=\"library\"/> → <Navigation item=\"filter\"/> → **Sort** section then in this case selecting **Total chapters**.\n:::\n\n### Browse\n\n#### Why can't I find X manga?\nSometimes you can struggle to find a source hosting the manga you're looking for, look here for some tips to help you find it.\n:::guide Tips to find your manga\n1. Look up the title on [Google](https://google.com/) or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).\n1. See if a website or scanlator has the series, then check the [Extensions](/extensions/) list.\n\n#### If you found the website/scanlator in the list\nDownload the corresponding extension, go to the source, then search for the manga there.\n#### If you didn't find the website/scanlator in the list\nIf you found a website or scanlator that hosts your manga but doesn't exist as a source or extension, then you can see if its [already been requested](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) or you can [request it yourself](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).\n\nIf the website/scanlator group doesn't have an online manga reader, you can download the manga manually and set up [local manga](/help/guides/reading-local-manga).\n:::\n\n### Reader\n#### Why are some images not displayed?\nAside from network issues, it could be because the images are too big or that the decoder doesn't support that image type.\n\n### Downloads\n#### What happened to the simultaneous downloads feature?\nIt was removed to prevent IP bans caused by too many requests. We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.\n\n#### Why are Downloads unstable?\nBe aware that it could be a network issue on your device or on the catalog you are trying to download from.\n\n#### Can you make it possible to store manga on both internal storage and external SD-card?\nAt the moment, no. You could try using symlinks but that requires having your phone rooted.\n:::note\nRead more about rooting your phone [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/root/)\n:::\n\n### Tracking\n#### How do I log in with Kitsu?\nTo log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.\n\n#### Why can't I find manga in MAL's search results?\nYou can search a manga from your MAL profile's list by searching in the following format: `my:<manga>`\n:::note\nRelated GitHub issue: [#65](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/65)\n:::\n\n### Local Manga\n#### How do I import my manga into Tachiyomi?\nWe recommend you to read [this](/help/guides/reading-local-manga) guide on how to do so.\n\n#### What do I do if I can't find the Tachiyomi folder?\nIf you don't see a **Tachiyomi** folder on your device, try downloading a chapter of any manga or creating a backup so that the folder can be created.\n\n### Application Updates\n#### How do I enable automatic updates?\nFrom version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.\n\nHowever, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"about\"/> → and click on **Check for updates**.\n\n#### Why are automatic updates not working?\n\nCertain devices such as MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from battery saver, go to <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_advanced\"/> and click on **Disable battery optimization**.\n\n### User Interface\n#### Can I change the app language?\n**Tachiyomi** is translated in 40+ different languages. By default, the app follows the language used on your device.\nOnly the UI has been localized, the language of the manga will still be using the language of the source selected.\n\n:::e-guide\nYou can change language by going to <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_general\"/> then pressing **Language**.\n:::\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n#### What is Tachiyomi Preview?\nIt's a weekly updated version of the app. It contains features that can be added to Tachiyomi in the future, but there is a higher chance for bugs. Tachiyomi Preview is used by developers and contributors to test the app and find bugs.\n\nIf you are willing to use Tachiyomi Preview, be sure to [turn on auto-backup](/help/guides/creating-backups/#turning-on-auto-backups) to prevent losing your library due to potential bugs.\n\n#### Why can't I uninstall Tachiyomi?\n\nOn **Android 10**, a bug was introduced which prevented users from uninstalling the app if the phone had a MicroSD card. To fix the issue, please remove the MicroSD card from the phone first, then uninstall Tachiyomi.\n\n#### Will there be an iOS version?\nThere is no iOS version and no plans for one. Since iOS and Android apps don't share code it's hard to port.\n\n#### Will Tachiyomi ever be on the Google Play Store?\nDue to Google Play's content policy, almost certainly not, as they do not allow the APK system to work. The content on some sites will lead to Google taking it down at some point, and Inorichi does not want to have to deal with it as they have stated [before](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/1745#issuecomment-441208074)\n\n#### How can I report Tachiyomi copycats on the Google Play Store?\nIf you're on desktop, fill out [this](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) form following [these](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH) steps.\n\n#### Can Tachiyomi read Light Novels?\nNo. Tachiyomi is an image parser, meaning it can't parse text.\n\n#### Can I revert back from the Material Design 2 update of Tachiyomi?\nWhile there will never be a toggle between the two UI versions, you can continue to use the old UI version by using [TachiyomiAZ](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/TachiyomiAZ/).\n\n#### Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?\nThe logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.\n\n#### I see manga images in my phone gallery, what gives!?\nTachiyomi by default adds a `.nomedia` file to prevent this from happening but sometimes it doesn't work or something went wrong. To fix this, all you need to do is create the file yourself. Name it `.nomedia` and place it in your download folder.\n\n#### I lost everything, what now?\nTo avoid data loss in the future, you can use the automatic backup feature.\n\n:::note\nLearn how to create automatic backups [here](/help/guides/creating-backups/#turning-on-auto-backups/)\n:::\n\n## Extensions\n\n### General\n\n#### What are some recommended extensions?\nTachiyomi does not endorse or recommend any manga source, and there is no best extension. Rather, we encourage users to spend some time to try out a few sources themselves, and discover what sources work best for them. It's because what works well for somebody else, might not work well for you.\n\n`<ElAlert type=\"info\" title=\"Disclaimer\" description=\"Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality.\" show-icon :closable=\"false\"></ElAlert>`\n\n#### What are scanlator sources?\nManga that are not officially licensed are translated by scanlators, who either publish manga on their own website or **MangaDex**. Scanlator sources always provide the fastest manga updates and have the highest scan quality.\n\nSome popular scanlator sources are  **MerakiScans**, **Hatigarm Scans** and **Leviatan Scans**. (in **Genkan** extension)\n\nLearn more about scanlation in this **Wikipedia** [**article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).\n\n#### Which sources are in the multi-source extensions?\nSome extensions contain multiple sources, look at the list below to find out which extension to install for the specific source that you want.\n\n:::e-guide\nUser [SnakeDoc83](https://github.com/snakedoc83) has made a handy spreadsheet showing the different multi-source extensions and their sources.\n:::note\nAccess the spreadsheet [here](https://tachiyomi.org/extensions-spreadsheet)\n:::\n\n#### How do I request a new extension?\nOpen an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) if one does not already exist.\n\n:::note\nYou can find the list of extensions to download [here](/extensions/)\n:::\n\n#### Why won't the extensions install?\nIn some cases your phone might have some issues downloading the extensions, in those cases you can try installing them yourselves directly from the source.\n\nTo install just download the file for the extension you want and then install it, like how you installed **Tachiyomi**.\n\n#### How do I allow third-party installations?\n::::: el-tabs\n:::: el-tab-pane label=\"Android 8.0 and higher\"\n:::videolink\n[<MaterialIcon icon=\"videocam\"/> Click for Android 8.0 and newer video guide](/assets/faq_unknown-sources-a10.webm)\n:::\nWhen installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.\n\nIn *newer* versions of **Android** you need to enable **Install unknown apps** by a per-app basis.\n::::\n:::: el-tab-pane label=\"Android 7.1 and lower\"\n:::videolink\n[<MaterialIcon icon=\"videocam\"/> Click for Android 7.1 and older video guide](/assets/faq_unknown-sources-a7.webm)\n:::\nWhen installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.\n\nIn *older* versions of **Android** you only need to enable **Unknown sources** globally.\n::::\n:::::\n\n:::note\nIf you need more help regarding this, read [this](https://www.theandroidsoul.com/how-to-allow-apps-installation-from-unknown-sources-on-android-9-pie/)\n:::\n\n#### How do I uninstall an extension?\nExtensions for **Tachiyomi** are technically installed the same as normal apps. Either you uninstall them through the app section on your phone's settings or you go can do it in the app.\n\n:::e-guide\nTo uninstall an extension from within **Tachiyomi**, go to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → **Extensions** then tap **Uninstall** on the extension you want to remove.\n:::\n\n#### Why don't I have extensions or any sources in Browse?\n- **Tachiyomi** no longer have pre-installed extensions, this means that you will need to install extensions you want to use from the <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → **Extensions** menu.\n- If you're getting the `Loader not implemented` error after clicking on a manga, you will need to reinstall the extensions you used to use.\n\n#### How do see sources of other languages?\n\nYou do this by following the steps below.\n\n1. Go to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → **Sources**.\n1. Click on <Navigation item=\"filter\"/> on the top right corner.\n1. Scroll down until you find the language of your source and enable it.\n\n#### Why can't I restore my backup?\nTo restore backups, **Tachiyomi** requires to have extensions installed for the respective manga you want to restore.\n\n\n#### Why can't I find manga when searching Browse?\nIt might be because the title is worded differently. Follow any of the steps below:\n- Look up the title on a search engine like **Google** or a manga tracking service such as [AniList](https://anilist.co/home).\n- See which site has the series, often a single source will not satisfy all your needs.\n- Download the extension for that source from <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → **Extensions** if it exists, read [this](/help/faq/#which-sources-are-in-the-multi-source-extensions) for a list of which extensions contains what sources.\n- Go to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> and tap on a source then search for the manga again.\n\n### MangaDex\n\n#### Why are there no results when searching?\n:::videolink\n[<MaterialIcon icon=\"videocam\"/> Click for video guide](/assets/faq_mangadex-no-results.mp4)\n:::\n\nIf you're not getting any results when searching **MangaDex** then you need to log in. To do so enter the <Navigation item=\"webview\"/> for **MangaDex** then press the **Manga** drop-down and choose either **Sign up** or **Log in** to proceed with the login.\n\n:::e-guide\nTo enter the **WebView** go to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → <Navigation item=\"button_latest\"/> next to **MangaDex**, then press on <Navigation item=\"webview\"/> in the top right corner.\n:::\n\n#### Why is MangaDex slow?\nIf pages are loading slowly or not at all, try:\n- Making sure you have the *latest* version of the extension.\n- Checking if **MangaDex** is either down, or is having the same issues.\n- Trying to **Clear database** under <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_advanced\"/>.\n- Trying to **Clear chapter cache** under <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_advanced\"/>.\n- Going to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → <Navigation item=\"extensions\"/> → **MangaDex** → **Image Server** and then selecting a *different* server location.\n\n`<ElAlert type=\"info\" title=\"Disclaimer\" description=\"Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality.\" show-icon :closable=\"false\"></ElAlert>`\n\n#### Is there an alternate searching method?\n**MangaDex** allows you to search using the ID number to find manga. The easiest way to get the ID is by opening the manga in your browser and looking at the URL.\n\n:::e-guide\nAn example search would be **`id:23427`** which would return results for [Candy & Cigarettes](https://mangadex.org/title/23427/candy-cigarettes)\n:::\n\n#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaDex?\nThis can be solved by opening **MangaDex** in <Navigation item=\"webview\"/> and block the scanlator group whose chapter you don't want to see.\n\n#### How do I fix chapters from Mangaplus being broken?\nInstall the **MANGA Plus by SHUEISHA** extension instead and then migrate the manga that uses **MANGA Plus** on **MangaDex** onto the **MANGA Plus** source.\n\n:::note\nRead about source migration [here](/help/guides/source-migration/)\n:::\n\n### MangaPark\n\n#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaPark?\nTo solve this issue, follow the below steps.\n\n1. Go to <Navigation item=\"browse\"/> → <Navigation item=\"extensions\"/>.\n1. Click on **MangaPark** extension and then **Chapter List Source**.\n1. Choose an option like **Smart list** or **Prioritize source**.\n1. Go back to **MangaPark**'s chapter list and refresh it.\n\n### Mangabox\n\n#### What does `Page list is empty` mean?\n**Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** have created new entries for manga on their sites again. Some old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/#source-migration) the manga from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to another source.\n\n#### What does `Source URL has changed` mean?\nThis means that the manga is dead and needs to be migrated from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to a different source. Refer to the guide for **Page list is empty** above.\n\n#### How do I fix the `Image could not be decoded` error?\nOpen the manga in WebView and wait for the image to comes up. If the image isn't loading you will need to look elsewhere to read that particular manga, as some Mangabox sources, such as Mangakakalot, are now blocking entire regions.\n\n### Webtoons.com\n\n#### How do I fix the `Page list is empty` error?\nYou will have to open the manga entry in WebView and verify your age, as Webtoons has recently added age verifications on their site.\n\n### Japscan\n\n#### Why are some Japscan chapters not loading?\nJapscan has some manga that are scrambled using a different algorithm than others on their site. If you encounter a manga being scrambled, use a different source to read.\n\n### KissManga and MangaRock\n:::: el-collapse\n:::el-collapse-item title=\"Where is KissManga?\"\n**KissManga** went under permanently in August 2020, we will not add something that doesn't exist back..\n:::\n:::el-collapse-item title=\"Where is MangaRock\"\n**MangaRock** converted from a piracy app and went legit, they are now called **INKR** but is nowhere near what they were before.\n:::\n::::","sidebar":"","next":"","prev":"","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Frequently Asked
